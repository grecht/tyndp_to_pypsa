The main driver for the project is to integrate the hydro-based Norwegian system with the thermal/nuclear/wind-based British system. The interconnector will improve security of supply both in Norway in dry years and in Great Britain in periods with negative power balance (low wind, low solar, high demand etc.). Additionally the interconnector will be positive both for the European market integration, for facilitating renewable energy and also for preparing for a power system with lower CO2-emissions.
